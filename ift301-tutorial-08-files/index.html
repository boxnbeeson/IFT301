			<h1>The New American University</h1>
			<section>
				<p>In his inaugural speech on November 8, 2022, Arizona State University President Michael Crow outlined his proposal for the "New American University". Over the last 20 years, his transformative vision has made Arizona State University one of the most innovative places on the planet, a place that measures academic quality by the education its graduates receive, prioritizes public good, and takes on a profound responsibility for the economic, social, and cultural well-being of the larger community. Below is an excerpt from President Crow's inaugural speech where he talks about his vision.</p>

				<h3>Transcript</h3>
				<p>
					Now, while we will draw from this historic model and try to move on, to move beyond it, we will draw from it the pieces that we need, and we will move forward to work to establish a new kind of American university, an American university, a new kind of American university built here in Arizona, which will be measured not by who the university excludes, but rather by who the university includes. Our new American university here at Arizona State will admit students with different interests and indicators of ability, not a narrow band indicator of ability or interest. Our new American university will judge the success of our institution by the success of each student on a case-by-case basis. You came with X, you left with Y. Our new American university at ASU will adapt to the waves of social and demographic change by getting out in front of those changes rather than trailing them, which is what we're doing now. We will understand them and engage in them by diversifying both by gender, by ethnicity and by race, those that make up the cadre of our intellectuals that are the heart of our university. We will, in this new American university, commit directly to an environment of creativity and scholarship and teaching for the community that will stimulate economic and social diversification in our broader community. And we will focus at this new American university on building the human capital for the next few generations, and the natural capital, our environment for the many generations, which require us to do that, that haven't even been conceived of yet. We'll do all of these things.
