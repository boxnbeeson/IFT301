			<p>The residential college experience combines the personal attention, support, and familial atmosphere of a small college with the extensive resources of a major research university. The Ira A. Fulton Residential College at the Polytechnic School is a cohesive, energetic community of scholars that seeks to broaden learning beyond the traditional classroom, laboratory, or workshop setting, allowing students and the greater ASU community to explore common intellectual and extra-curricular interests together. The residential college sponsors a broad range of social, cultural and intellectual activities, fostering interaction amongst the diverse community as well as helping students achieve academic, social, and career goals. Students have access to community mentors and upper-division students from a variety of Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering degree programs who serve as a resource to residents and assist in the planning of varied activities.</p>

			<article>
				Freshmen reside in the newly-built Century Hall. The new three-story, 84,000 square-foot residence hall has two wings. Century Hall creates an environment where students will live with peers who share the same major, can interact with faculty members and have access to academic resources and student services outside of the classroom. Each wing features student activity lounges for pool, foosball and table tennis. In addition, each floor includes a TV, two quiet study rooms and a laundry area free to Century residents. The two wings of the building are linked together by a one-story common area with a lobby, 24-hour information desk, administration offices, community kitchen, two multipurpose rooms, a group study room and a small collaborative studio known as the solution space. Outside the common area there are two gas grills, seating space and a courtyard. Note: There is an additional $49 per semester fee to live in a residential college community.
