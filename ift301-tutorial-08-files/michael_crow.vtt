00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.537
Now, while
we will draw from this historic model

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:10.143
and try to move on, to move beyond it,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.546
we will draw from it
the pieces that we need

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:17.884
and we will move forward to work
to establish a new kind

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:20.887
of American university,

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:22.856
an American university,

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:26.593
a new kind of American university
built here in Arizona,

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:31.698
which will be measured
not by who the university excludes,

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.568
but rather by who the university includes.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:44.110
[Applause]

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.045
Our new American

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.882
University here
at Arizona State will admit students

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.218
with different interests
and indicators of ability,

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:56.189
not a narrow band
indicator of ability or interest.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:01:01.327
Our new American University
will judge the success of our institution

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:06.466
by the success of each student
on a case by case basis.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:11.638
You came with X, you left with Y.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:12.939
Our new American University

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.110
at ASU will adapt to the waves of social
and demographic change

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.413
by getting out in front of those changes
rather than trailing them,

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.816
which is what we're doing now.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:26.052
We will understand them and engage in them

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:29.889
by diversifying
both by gender, by ethnicity

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:34.360
and by race, those that make up the cadre
of our intellectuals

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.429
that are the heart of our university.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:44.537
[Applause]

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:45.972
We will, in this new American

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:49.542
university, commit directly

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:54.214
to an environment
of creativity and scholarship

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:57.851
and teaching for the community
that will stimulate

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:01.554
economic and social diversification
in our broader community.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.724
And we will focus
at this new American university

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:08.261
on building the human capital

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:11.364
for the next few generations

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:15.435
and the natural capital,
our environment for the many generations

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:20.039
which require us to do that
that haven't even been conceived of yet.

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:21.274
We'll do all of these things...
